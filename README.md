This is a very simple password generator. 
It generates a password of variable length (between 12 and 64 characters) comprised of numbers, special chars, and upper/lowercase characters.
All password generation logic is contained in a separate class from main() and all password creation data members are local to methods.
I have implemented a millisecond timer to track improvements to the logic of the generator as I work on it over time.
